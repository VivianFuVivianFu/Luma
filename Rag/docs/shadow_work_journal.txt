What is your Shadow Side□
We all carry a shadow side. These are the negative aspects and vulner abilities of 
ourselves that we’d rather pretend don’t exist. Often, our shadow selv es are born 
in early childhood as the result of trauma or repressing emotions.
When you ignore your shadow self, it holds power over you. When you do shadow 
work exercises, the shadow is illuminated, and can then be integrated t o give you 
more awareness, strength, and stability.
In other words, you become conscious of what you’ve previously shoved i nto your 
subconscious by doing shadow work.
As you use this deep shadow work journal to illuminate your shadow self,  your 
conscious self is made aware of vulnerabilities, fears, and unconscio us habits that 
have been directed by the negative aspects of your shadow.
Wh y Should I Do  Shadow Wo rk□
To do shadow work is to uncover what your repressed qualities are and to heal 
from childhood experiences or traumas that formed your shadow. 
When you choose to ignore your shadow side, and remain largely unaware of it,  or 
unwilling to admit that it exists –The shadow gets darker, denser, and thicker.
This triggers knee -jerk “unconscious programming” reactions to challenges that 
arise in everyday life. We tend to react quickly to situations base d on previous 
fears, loss, or doubt, rather than slowly and carefully responding.
For example, perhaps you were accidentally left somewhere as a s mall child by 
your parents. Now, as an adult, you have an “unconscious program” of 
“abandonment” running in your shadow self subconscious.
If you are unaware that this incident created pain that you simply shoved down,  
but never looked at and healed, you may have issues of being too clingy in y our 
relationships as an adult, and ultimately pushing potential mates away .

How to Get the Most Out of this Journal□
As your shadow begins to be released, it is necessary to love your self 
unconditionally. After all, your shadow is usually born in childhood out of fea r of 
judgment, unworthiness, or withholding of love from someone.
Be kind, patient, and go easy on yourself. Your shadow has been hidden away  for a 
very long time. 
It takes patience and compassion to illuminate and integrate your sha dow for 
greater awareness and wholeness.Practice Unconditional Love

Benefits of Shadow Work
When you better understand your shadow and the qualities you’ve tried to hide, 
you’ll be more understanding of others and their shadows. You also won’t be a s 
triggered by other people’s behavior. Exploring your shadow also ma kes you more 
self-aware of how you are acting towards others, which makes you kinder and 
gentler.Healthier Relationships
Finding and illuminating your shadow makes you aware of all the negative  traits 
you tend to show when triggered.
Being unaware of our shadow sides makes us “react”, instead of “responding ” to 
emotional triggers.
Knowing that you’re prone to angry outbursts when pushed in a certain way  can 
change the way you respond to those triggers in the future.You Regain Control Over Yourself
Getting to know your shadow may show you that you have a tendency to dro wn 
your sorrows in a pint of ice cream rather than cry, because you were taug ht not to 
express your emotions as a child.
Now, when you are sad, you can let yourself cry and express the emotion rat her 
than stuff it down with food.Become Aware of Self -Destructive Behaviors
7
Even if you don’t consider yourself abused as a child, examining how your 
upbringing affected you and created your shadow, will help you be a better pare nt 
to your own children.Stop Cycles of Abuse
Shadow work allows you to feel more whole because you’re accepting a ll the parts 
that make you, you!
Shadow and all!
A healthy, balanced person understands their shadow well and accepts all the 
aspects of themselves, without judgement.
Then simply seeks to choose their words and actions more carefully w hen dealing 
with others.Better Acceptance of Self

How to Integrate Your Shadow Side
This book goes deep with questions and exercises that will reveal y our shadow self. 
Remember that the shadow may not always want to be found and may lash out  
when cornered.
We are shining a light on something that was told it had to stay in the dark and 
hidden. 
We may have even shoved our shadows down with alcohol and drugs. Our 
shadows “think” they belong there because they’ve been stuffed down for ye ars.
When you come to a place of understanding yourself, you will begin to under stand 
and accept the negative traits in others.
You will also be able to identify “cycles of abuse”, or “generat ional trauma”. These 
are things such as, My grandfather told my father that he was “wort hless” and 
“real men don’t cry”… He then passed this verbal abuse on to me.
It is easier to come to a place of forgiveness for the people who  passed unhealthy 
generational beliefs onto you, if you understand where that belief came fr om.Forgiveness
When your shadow is uncovered, you may sense large amounts of guilt, s hame, or 
fear. This is where self -love comes in. 
The world is ascending into the 5thdimension, and you cannot take your baggage 
with you! Shadow work is an essential part of raising your vibration enough to 
finally attract all the incredible things this life has to offer!
Hug your shadow. Smile at your shadow. Tell your shadow that it is no t it’s fault. Be 
the understanding guidance counselor to your shadow!
Pretend it is a small child who doesn’t yet know who to trust. Let yo ur shadow 
finally know that it CAN TRUST YOU. 
Tell your shadow that it is okay, and that you love it and understand why it  was 
formed.Unconditional Love
9
If you decide to fight or run from your shadow, the more it will hide. Or wo rse, 
chase you!
A red rose holds a very neutral vibration with its own grounding cord (ste m) and 
visualizing a red rose surrounding your shadow will demagnetize all the dense 
emotions holding it firmly in place.
I have seen my shadow show up as a wailing banshee of fear that chased me.  
Instead of running, I turned around and hugged it, until its fear subsided.
Other times the shadow shows up as a shaming voice in your head. I instant ly 
choose to picture a rose tool until this shame simply breaks apart .The Rose Tool
Integrating the shadow self requires love, love, and more love!
You ARE worthy! You ARE beautiful! It is OK to be open and honest with others! It 
is OK to cry and express your emotions!
As children we are told not to speak our minds, not to cry or express s trong 
emotions, that we are unworthy, not enough if we don’t live up to our pare nt’s 
expectations, and so on, and so on.
Our parents usually love us and say they just want what’s best for us. But no t all 
parents understand that what they think is best for us, may actually be 
detrimental.
Go easy on them and yourself!Love, Love, and More Love!

How to Illuminate Your Shadow
Remember that your shadow has been told it deserves to be hidden and to just  
stay down in the dark for many years.
Go easy on yourself and your shadow side, for it takes a lot of cour age to look at 
the parts of you that you have hidden away.
The following shadow work activities will help you to illuminate your sha dow so 
that you can love, forgive and understand it.
This will begin the healing and integration process.
I think the Imagine Dragons song is excellent at explaining Why to do the Mirror 
Gazing Exercise:
“When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide”
Your “demons” ARE your shadow, and staring into your own eyes, as we ll as the 
eyes of others, is a great way of illuminating the shadows.
Mirror gazing is uncomfortable for many, but is a very useful too l for facing your 
fears, wounds, and especially your insecurities.The Mirror Exercise
Grab a mirror that you can gaze comfortably into for 15 minutes . Time yourself if 
you are short on time or worried about time.
You may begin to see your flaws. Things such as wrinkles, gray hai r, a crooked nose, 
or an uneven eye may begin to pop into your awareness.
But, stick with it!How to do the Mirror Exercise
11
You may begin to get uncomfortable or uneasy, depending on how many phys ical 
flaws you perceive yourself to have.
If physical flaws come up, simply repeat these affirmations over and ov er, until you 
can do this exercise without physical flaws blocking you:
“I AM BEAUTIFUL!”
“I AM SAFE!”
“I AM UNDERSTOOD!”
“I AM LOVED!”
“I AM ADORED!”
Now, delve deeper and stare directly into your own eyes. Note t he color, the flecks 
of gold, the sparks of light. Stay with yourself. Stare into your e yes.
Now, talk to yourself as if you were your own wounded inner child. You ma y want 
to say things like, “It is safe to come out now”, or “You are  unconditionally loved 
and adored!”
If more fears surface, simply repeat:
“I AM SAFE”, “I AM SAFE”, “I AM SAFE”, and 
“IT IS OK TO BE ME!”

What Emotions Came Up? How Did You Respond to Those Emotions?
Any Aha Moments? How Do You Feel Now?

A trigger is a person, place, thing or situation that causes you  to have a negative 
emotional or behavioral response. 
Negative emotions where you react rather than responding to a sit uation or person 
may show up as: Anger, running and hiding, crying, violent outbursts, inabil ity to 
speak your truth or communicate honestly (simply shutting down and being qui et).
When you feel triggered, use this worksheet to break down exactly wh y you're 
feeling reactive, or reacted in a negative way… Wo rking Through Triggers

LittleKnown Shadow Wo rk Hacks
Illuminating your shadow side doesn’t always have to be difficult or ti me 
consuming. 
In fact, I was having a difficult time illuminating my shadow side wit h traditional 
methods.
As usual, prayer and meditation brought me to the following techniques fr om the 
Teacher’s of Light and my own spirit guides I work with.
My spirit guides did NOT prepare me for Rainbow Bright’s Tube of Heali ng! They 
simply said to “try it”, so I did!
This exercise brought my shadow to the forefront like nothing I’ve ever tried. Soon 
after practicing this visualization, my shadow was easily accessib le during dreams 
and in meditation.Rainbow Bright’s Tube of Healing
•Lie on your bed or sit in a comfortable position.
•Close your eyes and begin deep, circular breaths.
•Now visualize the brightest rainbow you can imagine surrounding your whol e 
body with a tube of rainbow light. Make it really glow! Make it a s bright as you 
can! Feel every sensation and play with child -like wonder as you do this!
•Hold the visualization for a few minutes or as long as you like, t hen go on about 
your day, or go to sleep.How to Practice Rainbow Bright’s Tube of Healing

LittleKnown Shadow Wo rk Hacks
Another simple exercise for illuminating your shadow side is drinking wate r 
charged with the cosmic diamond violet flame.
To illuminate and clear your shadow self, you need some powerful energ etic tools, 
tools that aren’t given in traditional shadow work journaling ex ercises.
Becoming aware of your shadow self is wonderful but clearing the sticky e nergetic 
residue of the shadow with these powerful energetic tools will do so much m ore!
I have found that when working with these tools, it is very helpful to e nter a state 
of playfulness! Your rational mind doesn’t understand the energetics of light  and 
sound like your aura and Soul will.
So, for this next exercise for shadow work –play, pretend, make it up, and most 
importantly, feel rather than overthink .
After doing this exercise, I immediately felt euphoric, however I  had more fears and 
pain brought to the forefront in my dreams for me to understand, heal, and 
unconditionally love and accept about myself.
If you are not ready to do this, it may be best to simply start with t he journal 
prompts.Drink Water Charged with the Cosmic Diamond Violet Flame
•Get a cup of clean filtered or spring water (Clean water is super impo rtant! No 
tap water please!)
•Place the water in front of you.
•Ask (with reverence), the Cosmic Diamond Violet Flame to enter you r water.
•Ask Ascended Master St. Germain and Archangels Zadkiel and Gabriel to assist 
with infusing your water with the Cosmic Diamond Violet Flame.
•Now, close your eyes and visualize the a beautiful bright violet diam ond 
completely surrounding your glass of water.
•Make it as bright as you can! Imagine it shining as brightly as a violet diamond 
sun would!
•Thank St. Germain, Archangel Zadkiel and Archangel Gabriel for their assistance!
•Now drink the water and then say the affirmation: “I AM the Cosmic Dia mond 
Violet Flame. I AM the Flame of Mercy. I AM the Flame of Joy. I AM the Flame o f 
Oneness. I AM Saint Germain. I AM Gabriel Zadkiel .”How to Charge Water with the Cosmic Diamond Violet Flame

Deep Shadow Wo rk Journal Prompts
Journal prompts for shadow work are essentially questions designed to probe and 
challenge the most negative traits of your subconscious psyche, such a s: anger, 
fear, doubt, greed, victimhood, lack, distrust, and jealousy.
Self discovery is the ultimate goal of shadow work and shadow work prompts are 
an ideal way to get to the root of your shadow.
When you ask yourself shadow work questions, and answer as honestly as you c an, 
you illuminate the side of you that you have most feared and repressed.
Once you are made aware of your shadow self, you can fully accept and 
unconditionally love it, which takes you off the “wheel of unconscious shado w self 
reactions”.
You can then begin to respond to your life, rather than react, run, hide, reject, or 
push away people or experiences that are healthy for you, or help you g row.

Inner Child Healing
As children, we long for unconditional love, support, and acceptance from our 
parents or caregivers.
When we experience childhood trauma, or don’t receive the unconditional l ove, 
support, and nurturing we desired –Our inner child becomes hurt, wounded, 
defensive, angry, ashamed, or guilted.
We may cope in adulthood with denial, pain, fears, repression (not fully  growing 
up), or develop co -dependent relationships with spouses, partners, or even friends.
It is time to heal and repair the wounds from past childhood pain by first 
acknowledging them.
Remember to go easy and take your time. Childhood traumas and pain are  often 
the most difficult to identify, look at, and forgive. Many of these m emories are 
painful. It is 100% OK to cry, punch pillows, and scream at this pain!

Inner Child Healing Continued…
Now that we’ve identified this pain, we are going to look for ge nerational patterns.
Oftentimes, your parents/guardians are simply regurgitating sha me, fear, guilt, etc. 
from their parents onto you unconsciously.
Perhaps you father was abused by your grandfather (which was more comm on 
back then), and he inflicted this physical/verbal/emotional abuse onto you as the 
only parenting skill he was taught.
These generational traumas/patterns can be identified, healed, and ended by  YOU! 
You are choosing to stop the cycles of unconsciousness by looking at them, 
understanding them, feeling the pain of them, and forgiving them.

Inner Child Healing
To heal the pain we felt in childhood from the adults who were supposed to 
unconditionally love and protect us, we have to identify and feel the pain.
I encourage you to let it out. Cry. Scream. Punch pillows. Go for  an angry hike/walk. 
Take the time to understand what your inner child needed, and why you didn’t 
receive it with these inner child journal prompts.
Maybe your mother had depression. Maybe she was exhausted, or sick a l ot. 
Maybe her mother shamed and guilted her, and that’s all she knew.
Or maybe your father was expected to be perfect, or a phenom at som ething, or 
his father pushed him to be a doctor, so he tried to push you.
Whatever the reasoning for your inner child not receiving the love/s upport all 
children need –We can go a long ways towards healing by identifying it.

Inner Child Affirmations
Now that we’ve journaled how we felt as children, identified generat ional 
traumas/cycles, and allowed ourselves to feel any pain that may  have come up 
during the inner child exercises –We can now begin to rebuild/affirm what we 
really needed as children.
The spoken word is very powerful. Our words carry weight, vibration, and 
eventually create our beliefs and actions –Which in turn, creates our realities.
We are “programmable” by the stories we tell ourselves, so it is time to  tell 
ourselves new stories!
Imagine if you would have been told as a child that you could accomplish a nything 
and to keep trying at your biggest dreams? Imagine if you were told y ou were 
capable, unconditionally loved, and could be anything or with anyone you wi shed?
Imagine if you were nurtured, supported, and cheered on by the adults in your 
childhood? It is time to do this for ourselves!
These affirmations are powerful, and even more powerful when spoken out loud. 
When repeated daily for at least 30 days, they will give your inn er child the 
strength it needs to rebuild/repair/let go of the past.

Sometimes, when a past relationship, trauma, or event is difficult  to get over –It 
can be helpful to work through it by making a pros/cons list.
Past traumatic events and relationships often cause us to relive t he event over and 
over in our minds. We wonder what we could’ve done differently or imagine  
fighting our ex -partner while making better points. LOL!
Since emotions can only be felt in the present, reliving past painful ev ents cause us 
to feel sad, angry, or victimized in the present –Which only increases anxiety and 
depression.
When making your pros & cons list, it is helpful to list exactly what the pa st painful 
event taught you. This will help you to realize how much stronger yo u are for living 
through the event and may help you view the pain or trauma with a new 
perspective of appreciation for what you learned.Pros & Cons List

Final Shadow Work Thoughts…
After working with my shadow side for about a decade, I have become a mo re 
balanced, aware, loving individual.
But, I don’t think there is ever a “done” when it comes to shadow work. N ew fears 
will inevitably “pop up” in dreams, meditation, or waking life.
Or,you may think that you looked at, forgave, loved, and therefore int egrated parts 
of your shadow, and suddenly it will be slammed into your face to be looke d at, 
and forgiven yet again.
But, now that you know how to do shadow work, you can turn to these exerci ses 
again and again… Dealing with each shadow as it comes up, instead of repre ssing 
or stuffing them.
However you choose to do shadow work, know that this journal is for you. Simply 
meaning, you don’t have to go at anyone else’s pace, or show anyo ne your shadow 
or shadow work.
The process to self -discovery and learning to love and accept all the parts of you 
can be scary, draining, and overwhelming.
But, it can also be beautiful, amazing, and very freeing! I truly hope that t his 
journal and workbook brought you to a better place!
A place where peace, love, acceptance, and balance is found within yourself , and 
will therefore be easy to give to others in return –Spreading more joy!
As always, choose to spread love, light, and kindness –Because it ALWAYS comes 
back!
Many blessings to you and yours! It is now time to hide from your shadows no 
more and step into the light where you’ve ALWAYS belonged!
