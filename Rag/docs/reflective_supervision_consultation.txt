The Reflective Practice Center (RPC) 
at the University of Minnesota Center 
for Early Education and Development 
(CEED) serves as an intellectual 
home for high-quality, cutting-edge 
research in reflective practice. At 
RPC, we disseminate knowledge 
about reflective practice, help 
professionals incorporate reflective 
practice principles into their work, 
and inform policy dealing with infant 
and early childhood mental health. 
Our center is the first of its kind 
internationally.

Reflective supervision/consultation 
(RS/C) is an innovative model of 
professional development used to 
support frontline workers—home 
visitors, early education teachers, 
early interventionists, child welfare 
workers, public health nurses, 
child care providers, juvenile 
justice workers, allied health 
professionals—anyone involved in 
providing services for children and 
families. 
Frontline workers need the 
support of RS/C because working 
with children and families who live 
in high-stress situations or have 
challenging problems requires 
large amounts of emotional 
energy. Working with children and 
families under those circumstances 
can feel overwhelming and 
emotionally draining, leading to 
burnout, emotional numbing, or 
even secondary traumatic stress 
symptoms. RS/C providers report that 
workers who receive RS/C show 
improvements in work skills and 
self efficacy, as well as decreased 
levels of burnout and turnover. For 
these reasons, RS/C is a promising 
practice growing in popularity.
We use the term “reflective 
supervisors” to refer to those who 
are employed by organizations 
and agencies who may provide 
administrative and/or clinical supervision to their staff members 
in addition to reflective supervision. 
“Reflective consultants” are hired 
by organizations or agencies to 
specifically provide reflective 
consultation to staff members of an 
organization or agency. 
Reflective practices, and RS/C, 
are used by professionals in a wide 
range of human service, medical, 
and educational fields. Most 
recently, we have concentrated on Reflective supervision/consultation 
(RS/C) is an innovative model of 
professional development used to 
support anyone involved in providing 
services for children and families.

c e n t e r  f o r e a r ly  e d u c at i o n  a n d d e v e lo p m e n tunderstanding and promoting the 
use of RS/C in the field of early 
childhood development, care, and 
education. 
At RPC, we conducted a 
nationwide landscape survey 
investigating the training, delivery, 
and impact of RS/C in the early 
childhood field. State infant and 
early childhood organizations, RS/C 
providers, and RS/C recipients 
responded to questions regarding 
types and delivery of training they offer and have received, 
supports and barriers to offering 
and receiving RS/C training, and 
the impact RS/C had on their 
professional and personal lives.
The results were powerful. 
RS/C providers and recipients 
passionately describe the positive 
impact RS/C has on their emotional 
resilience, their approach to 
serving families, and their ability 
to work effectively with colleagues 
and families. Organizations and individuals confirm the strong 
demand for RS/C training across all 
31 respondent states and a need to 
increase access to RS/C training. 
They also describe gaps in RS/C 
training that need to be addressed.
There are very few professional 
practices that offer ongoing support 
to the early childhood workforce and 
that convey multiple professional 
and personal benefits. This book will 
help answer questions about RS/C 
and its impact on the field. We hope 
that this information can inform 
your practice or encourage your 
organization to explore incorporating 
RS/C into its professional 
development strategy. Providers and recipients describe  
the positive impact RS/C has on  
their emotional resilience and their 
ability to work effectively with 
colleagues and families.

“I have seen professionals grow 
internally and within the external 
relationships, truly see their own 
value in the relationships they have 
with others and how powerful those 
relationships are in the healing, 
growing, and changing capacities of 
ourselves and those we work with.”

c e n t e r  f o r e a r ly  e d u c at i o n  a n d d e v e lo p m e n tRS/C is ongoing professional 
development that involves regularly 
scheduled discussions between a 
trained supervisor or consultant and 
staff members, either individually 
or in groups. RS/C sessions, which 
last between 60-120 minutes, 
may be held in person or via video 
conferencing. During these discussions, frontline 
workers in early childhood fields 
learn how to manage their emotional 
responses to their work with families. 
They also learn how to use those 
emotional responses, along with 
knowledge about child development 
and parent perspectives, to more 
effectively serve families.Supervision is 
considered reflective 
if it includes:
1. Regularity:  
Committing to a 
protected, consistent, 
regularly scheduled 
meeting time.  
2. Reflection:  Stepping 
back from the 
experience to sort 
through feelings and 
thoughts about what 
one is observing and 
doing.
3. Collaboration:  
Working together as a 
partnership in which 
control of power is 
shared, rather than 
an expert/learner 
dynamic.◗   What Is Reflective 
Supervision/  
Consultation?
RS/C is ongoing professional 
development that involves  
regularly scheduled discussions 
between a trained supervisor or 
consultant and staff members, either 
individually or in groups.

c e n t e r  f o r e a r ly  e d u c at i o n  a n d d e v e lo p m e n tDeep reflection depends on 
feeling safe enough for both 
reflective supervisor and supervisees 
to recognize and acknowledge 
challenges and mistakes, admit bias, 
and tolerate not always knowing 
the “right” answer while moving 
forward in their work. High-quality 
reflective supervisory relationships 
incorporate empathy, vulnerability, 
and a willingness to entertain 
multiple possibilities without jumping 
to conclusions. This means that a 
trusting relationship between the supervisor and supervisee is key to 
successful RS/C. 
Our research shows RS/C 
providers are supervisors or 
consultants who come from many 
different human service, medical, 
and educational fields, including 
home visiting, child welfare, mental 
health, child care, early intervention, 
and the allied health professions. 
In our sample, the majority have 
master's degrees. Most of those with 
master's degrees have credentials 
in infant mental health or social work, and have been providing 
RS/C between one and 10 years. 
The majority received their training 
from multiple sources while they 
were working in the field, continue 
to receive ongoing RS/C themselves, 
and hold an endorsement 
documenting their qualifications for 
being an RS/C provider. They are 
passionate about providing RS/C 
because they themselves have 
benefited from it and have witnessed 
its impact on early childhood 
professionals.
Individuals who work directly 
with children and families are 
candidates for receiving RS/C: home 
visitors, early education teachers, 
early interventionists, child welfare 
workers, public health nurses, child 
care providers, juvenile justice 
workers. Reflective supervisors also 
receive RS/C because the ongoing 
experience of receiving it is seen as 
necessary to continuing to effectively 
provide it to others. Deep reflection depends on both 
supervisor and supervisees feeling safe 
enough to acknowledge challenges and 
mistakes, admit bias, and tolerate not 
always knowing the “right” answer.

“I can honestly say that I’ve 
been transformed by the practice 
of RS/C, in innumerable ways, 
including how I think about myself, 
about others, about work, about 
contexts...I believe that I am more 
compassionate, humble, strong as 
a result of this practice. Braver. 
More competent.“

c e n t e r  f o r e a r ly  e d u c at i o n  a n d d e v e lo p m e n tWe have been accumulating 
evidence about the impact RS/C has 
on knowledge, skills, and morale of 
supervisors and recipients. 
One example comes from 
extensive interviews done with 
15 early intervention providers 
(teachers; speech, occupational, and 
physical therapists; psychologists) 
from a school district who received 
monthly group RS/C. Analyses of 
themes from their descriptions of 
their experience over time led to 
the creation of the “4Rs” model to 
describe the mechanisms of change.Release : RS/C provides an outlet 
for participants to release the 
mental and emotional stress that 
builds up while working directly with 
highly stressed families and young 
children. Participants were able to 
voice concerns and frustrations and 
receive validation and affirmation. 
The experience of being held safely 
in the relationships within their 
group acted as a safety valve, so they 
could let go of the strong emotions 
that arose from their work.
Reframe : Participating in safe 
relationships allowed practitioners 
to ask themselves questions about 
their work, consider multiple 
perspectives, and unpack their 
own biases. These processes were 
critical to understanding family 
context and seeing clients from a 
strengths-based perspective.Refocus : RS/C helped practitioners 
distill the areas of their work where 
they believed they could have the 
most impact despite the multiple 
stressors facing each family. It 
helped them think of new ways to 
approach their work and reduced 
feelings of helplessness and 
hopelessness.
Respond : Participating in RS/C 
helped practitioners slow down 
and become more flexible in their 
work. They reported becoming more 
responsive to families’ needs rather 
than their own fixed agenda. They 
were able to purposefully create 
the safe, trusting relationships with 
families necessary for their work.◗   The Impact of RS/C

“My whole life has been enriched

partner/children, friends, professional 
colleagues, and probably even 
strangers benefit from my practice  
of being curious, authentic,  
non-judgmental, content not to know.”

c e n t e r  f o r e a r ly  e d u c at i o n  a n d d e v e lo p m e n tRS/C is being advanced by 
organizations across the country: 
at least 38 states have infant 
mental health (IMH) associations 
that frequently promote RS/C as a 
professional development strategy. 
Many state IMH associations offer in-
person trainings on RS/C, with some 
offering it online. Programs most 
often offer continuing education 
credit, but some offer academic 
credit or credit that can be applied 
towards endorsement. 
Endorsement is a system used 
by state IMH associations that 
are members of the Alliance for 
the Advancement of Infant Mental 
Health. Created by the Michigan 
Association for Infant Mental Health, 
the endorsement system honors 
professionals who apply infant 
and early childhood mental health 
principles to their practice. It is 
granted through documentation 
and verification of the required specialized education, work, and 
in-service training, including 
RS/C. Although relatively new, the 
endorsement process has already 
moved the field ahead rapidly by 
ensuring that those who earn certain 
endorsement levels are qualified to 
provide high-quality RS/C.
IMH associations also embed 
information about RS/C in 
presentations and trainings, 
conversations with colleagues, 
and through endorsement systems 
for RS/C practitioners. There are 
some institutions of higher learning 
that offer certificate programs that 
include RS/C or exposure through 
graduate clinical training programs.
RIOS™: Reflective Interaction 
Observation Scale
The RIOS is a tool used both for 
research and as a practice guide 
to define and describe the topics of 
conversation and depth of reflection present in a reflective supervision 
session. 
The RIOS evolved from a 
collaboration between the Alliance 
for the Advancement of Infant 
Mental Health and RPC. After a 
dozen clinical and research experts 
engaged in intensive revision, 
discussion, and field testing, it is 
now being used as a framework 
for understanding the unique 
components of RS/C. 
The RIOS defines and 
operationalizes the process of 
reflective supervision by identifying 
its unique components. It helps 
articulate what occurs in the 
complex relationship between 
supervisor and supervisee(s) and 
differentiates reflective supervision 
from other forms of relationship-
based professional development.◗   Training and Tools

c e n t e r  f o r e a r ly  e d u c at i o n  a n d d e v e lo p m e n tEssential Elements
The RIOS groups the content of RS/C into five  
defining constructs, or Essential Elements, based  
on infant mental health theory and practice. 
>  Understanding the Family Story
>  Holding the Baby in Mind
>  Professional Use of Self
>  Parallel Process
>  Reflective AllianceCollaborative Tasks
The reflective process encompasses a cumulative 
and overlapping progression of Collaborative Tasks 
that the supervisor and supervisee(s) engage in 
together.
>  Describing – “What do we know?”
>   Responding – “How do we and others think and 
feel about this?”
>  Exploring – “What might this mean?”
>  Linking – “Why does this matter?”
>  Integrating – “What have we learned?”

CEED offers two online courses that explore 
the RIOS in depth. More information can be

“I have watched practitioners

idea that they are agents of change  
and that it is their relationships 
with their clients that create 
change. I believe that happens 
through the relationships we 
develop in RS.”

c e n t e r  f o r e a r ly  e d u c at i o n  a n d d e v e lo p m e n t◗   The Future of RS/C
Based on state IMH association 
responses, three main challenges 
need to be addressed: improve the 
buy-in, valuing, and prioritizing of 
RS/C by key stakeholders; increase 
available funding and financial 
resources for RS/C; and increase the 
capacity and number of high quality 
RS/C providers. There also is a 
need for continued research to build 
the evidence base and refine best 
practices.  
Promote awareness and buy-in 
at a systemic level
While some state IMH associations 
have successfully increased 
awareness, understanding, and 
buy-in from stakeholders in their 
states, others note that this basic 
foundation of buy-in is necessary 
before they are able to succeed at 
the substantive challenges around 
funding and building a high-quality 
workforce. Continue to build a cadre of 
high-quality RS/C providers
In our landscape survey, 68% of the 
responding associations reported 
that they provide training in RS/C. 
While other organizations may also 
offer training (e.g., institutions of 
higher learning), there is a clear 
need to increase the amount 
of training available and help 
individuals access training. 
As the field continues to 
progress, there is a need for 
advanced ongoing training. Survey 
respondents offered suggestions 
for advanced training topics: 
working with the dynamics of 
group supervision, understanding the developmental progression of 
reflective capacity, balancing the 
needs of administrative supervision 
with those of reflective supervision, 
offering more didactic training, and 
addressing equity and disparities. 
Because RS/C is a relational 
practice, RS/C providers also 
seek to be part of communities 
with other RS/C providers. Strong 
peer relationships with other RS/C 
providers afford support for their 
own work, just as RS/C providers 
offer support to the children and 
families with whom they work. 
Participating in communities of 
learning for RS/C practitioners is 
also essential.

c e n t e r  f o r e a r ly  e d u c at i o n  a n d d e v e lo p m e n tAdd to the evidence base and 
refine best practices
While evidence documenting the 
impact of RS/C on RS/C providers 
is beginning to accrue, it is also 
necessary to document its impact on 
children and families. Furthermore, 
as the field incorporates RS/C 
as a regular, ongoing practice, 
researching how to make RS/C most 
useful and effective by investigating 
implementation variables such as 
variations in dosage, formats, and 
training will be critical. For example, 
what is the optimal length of an RS/C 
session? How often should RS/C 
be offered to be most effective? Is 
provision of RS/C online as effective 
as in-person? What are the most 
effective strategies for training RS/C 
providers?
RS/C is a promising professional 
development practice, because there 
is growing evidence that it helps 
practitioners handle challenging 
situations and emotions and promotes 
their well-being. As part of our 
landscape survey, an Infant and Early 
Childhood Mental Health Consultant from Alabama shared, “I’ve had at 
least three providers who walked into 
my office saying immediately that they 
saw no need in [RS/C] because they 
were going to quit their jobs anyway. 
A year and a half later and no one has 
left their jobs.” Efforts are expanding to meet the demand for training 
and ongoing RS/C—a demand that's 
increasing because of this practice's 
capacity to reduce burnout, improve 
effectiveness, and restore a sense of 
purpose for workers who are on the 
front lines with families every day.
