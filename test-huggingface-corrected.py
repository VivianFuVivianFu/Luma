Corrected Hugging Face API test with proper error handling
The original code had these issues:
1. os.getenv("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") - wrong usage, should be os.getenv("HF_TOKEN")
2. The token may not have permissions for inference API
3. Need proper error handling and fallback approaches
