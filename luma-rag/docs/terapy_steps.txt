Objective:  This research was conducted to examine the effect of 
cognitive processing therapy and holographic reprocessing on the 
reduction of posttraumatic cognitions in students exposed to trauma  . 
Method:  This was an experimental study with spread pretest -posttest 
randomized groups design. Statistical society of this research consisted of 
male freshman, junior and senior high school students of Uremia 
(N=10286). Utilizing Traumatic Events Screening Invento ry, and SCL -90 
R on 1000 randomly selected high school students, 129 students were 
recognized as having experienced traumatic events. Of the subjects, 60 
were selected randomly. Then, clinical interview was conducted, and the 
selected sample was randomly a ssigned in to three groups of cognitive 
processing therapy, holographic reprocessing and control. These groups 
responded to Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory in pretest and post test. 
Differences of pre -post test scores were analyzed using one way ANOVA 
and Scheffe test  . 
Result s: The results demonstrated significant differences between the 
three groups in total score of the Posttraumatic Cognition Inventory. 
Difference was also observed in negative cognitions on self and self -
blame dimensions. Furthermore , these two therapeutic methods were 
equally effective in the reduction of posttraumatic cognitions    . 
Conclusion:  It appears that cognitive processing therapy and 
holographic reprocessing which had been originally developed and tested 
for sexually assaul ted females, can also be applied for the victims of other 
traumatic events, particularly  adolescents.

Exposure to traumatic events is common, with 
estimated lifetime rates ran ging from 26 to 92.2 percent 
in men, and 17.7 to 87.1 percent in women (1, 2, 3, 4). 
In the National Comorbidity Survey, 60.7% of 
American adults reported experiencing at least one 
traumatic event during their lifetime; of them, 8.2% of 
men ,and 20.4% of w omen developed posttraumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD)(5).  More than half of children 
and adolescents in the United States, have experienced 
at least one traumatic event such as child abuse, sexual 
assault, domestic violence, community violence, 
bullying, se rious accidents, fires, disasters, medical 
trauma, or the traumatic death of a loved one. 
Approximately a quarter of the exposed children 
developed significant symptoms, especially the  
symptoms of PTSD related to the experienced 
traumatic event (6).  
Trau matized people are at an increased risk for other 
psychiatric and medical conditions. These negative  
effects are not restricted to childhood, but are also seen 
in adults. In adulthood, survivors of early childhood 
traumas are at the risk of PTSD as well a s other   
 
anxiety, affective, addictive, psychotic, and personality 
disorders (7); besides, they might be in danger of re -
victimization (8). In the cognitive view, following a 
trauma, survivors typically adopt negative perceptions 
about the self and the w orld (9). It was proposed that 
these negative cognitions about trauma and/or its 
sequel may produce serious current threat, which is 
critical to persistent PTSD (10).  
Although exposure to some stressful and traumatic 
events in children and adolescents is inevitable, 
identifying, diagnosing and offering early effective 
therapies can prevent them from the subsequent 
outcomes. Current studies have questioned the efficacy 
and safety of pharmacological interventions in the 
treatment of posttraumatic symptoms in  adolescents, as 
they are in the developmental stage. Some years ago, 
the prominent approach in the treatment of traumatized 
children was cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The 
application of this method in the treatment of 
physically and sexually abused children and 
adolescents has attained strong evidences for 
supporting its effectiveness on the reduction of 
psychiatric symptoms (11). By studying groups of Original Article 
Iran J Psychiatry 2011 ; 6:138-144  
Cognitive Processing Therapy  For Post Traumatic States  
  139 Iranian J Psychiatry 6:4, Fall 2011  patients with PTSD, Foa and Rauch reported that 
negative cognitions about self are reduced followin g 
prolonged exposure therapy (12). The application of 
CBT in the treatment of psychological symptoms 
related to other traumatic evens has attained variable 
effect sizes. This problem caused researchers to follow 
the trauma -focused psychotherapies in the t reatment of 
traumatized children and adolescents (11).    
Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and holographic 
reprocessing (HR) are two effective methods of trauma 
related psychotherapies in the treatment of traumatized 
subjects. Cognitive -processing therapy  (CPT), a 
therapeutic programs developed by Resick and 
Schnicke et al. (1992), combines the exposure therapy 
and the cognitive restructuring/skill development. 
Historically, it had been tested in the populations of 
sexually assaulted females  (13, 14). Rese archers have 
shown the effectiveness of this intervention within the 
variety of traumatized populations, such as veterans 
(15), refugees (16), incarcerated adolescents (17), and 
motor vehicle victims (18). Holographic reprocessing 
(HR) is a cognitive -exper iential psychotherapy based 
on Epstein's cognitive experiential self -theory of 
personality (CEST). HR uses the principles of this 
personality theory to access information about 
cognitive, emotional and behavioral tendencies that 
lead to the replication of situations,  and replays of 
different aspects of the previous trauma and it also 
alters those patterns. HR is an integrative approach to 
psychotherapy, combining a variety of techniques such 
as cognitive -behavioral therapy, psychodynamic 
therapy and experi ential therapy. In addition, HR uses 
the hologram as a model to reconstruct traumatic 
memories.  
To date, only one controlled experimental research has 
studied the effectiveness of the holographic 
reprocessing therapy. In that research, Katz et al. (20) 
attained successful results with the application of this 
method to alert posttraumatic cognitions in the sexually 
assaulted women. This therapeutic method was not 
applied for the victims of other traumas and its 
effectiveness, compared to the evidence based 
therapies such as cognitive processing therapy, was not 
confirmed. Thus, considering the high occurrence of 
traumatic events and susceptibility of children and 
adolescents, it is important to introduce therapeutic 
methods for posttraumatic symptoms in chil dren and 
adolescents. The aim of this study was to examine the 
effectiveness of these two therapeutic methods on the 
reduction of posttraumatic cognitions ,and to compare 
these methods with a control group.   
 
Materials and Method  
This was an experimental study with spread pretest - 
post test randomized groups design.  
 
Participants  
Statistical society of this research consisted of male 
freshman, junior and senior high school students  in 
city of Uremia in 2010 -2011 school – year (N=10286). One thousand stude nts, approximately 10 percent of 
this statistical society, were randomly selected for 
screening traumatic events (current and previous 
injuries, hospitalizations, domestic violence, 
community violence, disasters, accidents, physical 
abuse) and psychologica l symptoms. Fifty five students 
refused to respond to the inventories, 129 of the 
subjects (13/63%) were exposed to at least one 
traumatic event based on Children Traumatic Events 
Screening Inventory and had a score of higher than 90 
in the Symptom checkli st-90 (SCL -90). Of the 
subjects, 60 were randomly selected. Then, clinical 
interview was conducted, and the selected sample was 
randomly assigned in to three groups of cognitive 
processing therapy, holographic reprocessing and 
control.  
 
Measures  
Traumatic  Events Screening Inventory - Self report 
Form (TESI -SR): TESI is a 24 item scale developed by 
Ford et al. (2002) for the purpose of probing the history 
of exposure to traumatic events and distinguishing 
these events from other negative life experiences in 
Children and adolescents aged 6 – 18. The TESI 
inquires about a variety of traumatic events, including 
current and previous injuries, hospitalizations, 
domestic violence, community violence, disasters, 
accidents, physical, and sexual abuse. The issue of 
whether the child’s reactions raised to the level of 
Criterion B of PTSD is evaluated in this inventory. It 
should be noted that in this research, items related to 
sexual abuse were omitted from the inventory  by 
HARASAT office located in education department . 
TESI showed good correlation with other screening 
traumatic events inventories. The alpha coefficient of 
this inventory was reported to be 0/89(21). This 
coefficiency was obtained to be 0/76 in the initial 
sample (n=946) of this research.  
Structured Clin ical Interview:  
The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -IV (SCID ) 
is a well -established semi -structured interview for the 
use of establishing Axis I and II diagnoses which is 
consistent with the DSM -IV. This interview was used 
to diagnose disorders rela ted to trauma, and to confirm 
diagnosis of SCL -90. Previous versions of the SCID 
have adequate reliability and validity for clinical and 
research purposes (22).  
Symptom Check -List 90 -Revised (SCL90 -R): The 
SCL90 -R consists of 90 items which measures nine 
symptom domains and provides a global index of 
emotional distress and the Global Severity Index. This 
scale can be completed in approximately 15 minutes. 
The high scores correspond to greater severity of 
symptoms. Internal consistency of this scale ranges 
from 0/71 to 0/84 across all nine scales, and its test –
retest reliability ranges from 0/67 to0/91 (23). Internal 
consistency of this scale in Iranian sample ranged from 
0/77 for psychos to 0/90 for depression (24). 
Cronbach’s alpha of this scale in the cur rent sample 
ranged from 0/69 for phobia to 0/86 for depression.

 140 Iranian J Psychiatry 6:4, Fall 2011  Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI): The PTCI 
is a 36 item self -report measure which assesses trauma 
related thoughts and beliefs. Individuals rated the 
occurrence of thoughts and belief s using a seven -point 
Likert scale. The measure loads on three factors of 
negative cognitions about self, negative cognitions 
about the world, and self -blame. The PTCI 
discriminated the traumatized individuals with and 
without PTSD more effectively compare d to the world 
Assumptions Scale and the Personal Beliefs and 
Reactions Scale which do not include cognitions 
specific to the sequel of traumatic events (25). Alpha 
coefficients of the three subscales were reported to be 
0/87 for the negative cognitions ab out self, 0/88 for the 
negative cognitions about the world, and 0/86 for self -
blame (25). In the current study, for the total scale, 
these coefficients were 0/86, 0/67, 0/70 and 0/88 
respectively for the three groups.  
Data were collected after recognizing  129 subjects 
(13/63%) as being exposed to at least one traumatic 
event based on Children Traumatic Events Screening 
Inventory and had a score of higher than 90 in the 
Symptom Checklist -90(SCL -90). Sixty subjects were 
randomly selected; and clinical intervi ew was 
conducted. Then, the selected sample was randomly 
assigned in to three equal groups of cognitive 
processing therapy (n=20), holographic reprocessing 
(n=20) and control group (n=20). At this stage, 
posttraumatic cognitions inventory was conducted as a 
pre test. Then, cognitive processing therapy and 
holographic reprocessing were performed as the 
therapeutic interventions on the experimental groups. It 
is important to note that because these therapeutic 
methods were not used for Iranian samples to date , the 
manuals of these methods were translated to Farsi. 
Next, based on the opinion of two psychotherapists 
about the effectiveness of these therapeutic methods on 
the posttraumatic symptoms and their correspondence 
with Iranian culture, they were applied in this research. 
Because the control group was attention only control 
group , Therefore, Six 30 - minute sessions of group 
conversation  about the six following issues were 
provided: adolescence period; education; 
communication with school staffs; counseli ng; learning 
and studying methods; and relationship between girls 
and boys . These interventions were conducted by one 
of the researchers of the current study. To examine the 
effectiveness of therapeutic intervention, differences of 
pre-post test scores we re analyzed using one way 
ANOVA and Scheffe test. The details of each 
intervention are as follows:  
Cognitive processing therapy (CPT):  According to 
manual developed by Resick   et al. (26), this method 
comprised of 12 one -hour therapy sessions. Basic 
issues  of the sessions are as follows:  
First and second sessions: After rapport was built with 
subjects, the necessary information  about their current 
problems was provided  to them, their symptoms were 
evaluated, and the structure of therapeutic sessions was 
determined. Existent disorders of the subjects were explained to them based on the cognitive viewpoint 
and treatment was offered to them. At the end of the 
second session, subjects were instructed to write about 
the meaning of their tramatization  experience , and how 
it affected their views of themselves, others and the 
world.  
Third and fourth sessions:  In these sessions, the 
meaning of traumatic events was established, and 
written exposure was applied based on what subjects 
had written at the impact stateme nt. Furthermore, ABC 
method was used to address the relationship between 
subjects' thoughts and affections.      
Fifth and sixth sessions:  Subjects were helped to 
reappraise their beliefs about the experienced traumatic 
event. Cognitive restructuring techni ques were 
introduced to them and they were questioned about 
their beliefs, using the list of challenging questions. 
Then, the subjects were asked to address their thoughts 
and beliefs by self monitoring orderly and challenged 
them by using the challenging questions.  
Seventh to Twelfth sessions: Subjects' excessive and 
over-generalized beliefs about self were recognized, 
and they were helped to deal with them. Furthermore, 
subjects were helped to recognize, reappraise and 
review beliefs related to safety, trust, control, self 
esteem and intimacy. At the end of the twelfth session, 
the meaning of traumatic event was viewed again, and 
subjects were asked to write a new report about their 
traumatic event, and review the previously rewritten 
report. They also w ere helped to recognize how their 
beliefs have been altered. The concepts and skills that 
were introduced during the therapy were reviewed. 
Finally, subjects were asked to think about their 
achievement and reward themselves, as they have 
learned to cope wi th their experience of traumatic 
event.  
Holographic reprocessing (HR):  According to manual 
developed by Katz (2005), this method was conducted 
in three stages (two step in each stage). In sum, therapy 
was offered in six sequential steps. Since the total 
therapeutic sessions consisted of nine 45 minute 
sessions, three sessions were allocated to each stage.  
 
First stage: safety  
Step 1) Establishing a therapeutic alliance: According 
to therapeutic manual, the following techniques were 
used to establish ther apeutic alliance: 1) establish a 
good fee ling; 2) Educate, normalize and make the 
client right ; 3) Address resistance, transference and 
counter -transference.  
Step 2) Ensuring a foundation of coping skills: At this 
step, the following coping skills were  taught to the 
subjects: 1) Relaxation techniques (Signal breath, 
Cleansing breath, Relaxation sandwich, Counting 
exercise, and Personal biofeedback machine); 2) 
Detecting feelings (Body scan/Emotional scan, 
Deciphering messages); 3) Tolerating the experie nced 
affects  (by Mindful observation, deliberate distraction, 
five ways to express feelings); 4) Shifting feelings; 5) 
Building emotional resiliency (Maypole of support); 6) 
Cognitive Processing Therapy  For Post Traumatic States  
  141 Iranian J Psychiatry 6:4, Fall 2011  Addressing such symptoms as nightmares, intrusive 
thoughts and panic; 7) creating a feelings plan  
 
Second stage: discovery  
Step 3) Engaging in experiential discovery: At this 
step, the subjects were helped to engage in experiential 
discovery by using the following techniques: 1) 
Connecting with the experience; 2) Identifying the 
feeling; 3) Free associat ion with images , memories, or 
other feelings  
Step 4) Mapping the experiential hologram: At this 
step, a simple image of a pot on a stove is offered to 
help the subjects organize and explain the components 
of the experiential hologram.  In this analogy, each 
component is matched with an aspect of the image (the 
acquired motivation is matched with turning on the 
stove; the core violation is matched with the hot 
burner; the boiling contents inside the pot correspond 
to the personal truth i ncluding the associated feelings, 
assumptions, and beliefs that boil to the surface; the lid 
on the pot attempts to contain the boiling contents; the 
lid represents coping strategies; keeping the lid on tight 
to avoid the steam is the avoidance strategy; a nd 
keeping the lid on loosely to release the pressure of the 
steam is the compensation strategy; the steam that 
escapes from the pot corresponds to the residual 
negative emotions that linger in between cycles of the 
hologram).  
 
Third stage: reprocessing  
Step 5) Reprocessing the experiential hologram: The 
following techniques were used to reprocess 
experiential hologram:  
 1) Nine steps for Reprocessing (Contextualize scene, 
ask for permission, induce relaxation, approach the 
scene, set the stage, assess for  level of distress, rescript 
the scene, complete and debrief); 2) Techniques to 
recontextualize a scene (Hindsight advantage, Age 
comparison); 3) Techniques to ensure emotional 
distance(Observer vantage point, Remaining current 
age, Changing attributes); 4 ) Goals for reprocessing (Completing communication, releasing and integrating 
affect, gaining a new perception, increasing power and 
safety);5) Reprocessing techniques (Imagery 
rescripting, fantasy, role -playing, story board, 
emotionally connected conversa tion, guided imagery).  
Step 6) Establishing new patterns: At this step, subjects 
were briefed on the impact of reprocessing and its 
application in their future. They were also guided to 
develop the skills to set new goals, develop new self -
concept and cou ntering images.   
 
Results  
Sixty students who had experienced at least one 
traumatic event ,and had a score of higher than 90 in 
SCL-90 R were studied in three groups of cognitive 
processing therapy, holographic reprocessing and 
control ; each group consi sted of 20 subjects (n= 20). 
Four subjects in the cognitive processing group, 2 in 
the holographic reprocessing group, and 5 in the 
control group did not complete the intervention 
programs, thus they were excluded from this study.   
Demographic features of  participants in the three 
groups are demonstrated in table 1. According to this 
table, the results of χ2 test for the variables of 
educational field  and educational level, and the one 
way ANOVA test for age variable demonstrated no 
significant difference between the groups in these 
variables.  
Table 2 demonstrates th e mean and standard deviation 
of pre - test and post - test scores in the three groups.  
Table 3 showed the results of ANOVA for comparing 
the means of differences between pre -test and post -test 
scores in posttraumatic cognition inventory.  As 
observed in this  table, a significant difference exists 
between the three groups in the subscales of negative 
cognitions about self (F=6/70, p<0/003), self -blame 
(F=18/40, p<0/001) and the total scale (F= 8/66, 
p<0/001).

Furthermore, the results showed that the three groups 
did not  differ significantly from one another with 
respect to negative cognitions about the world. 
According to table 4, the results of Scheffe test showed 
that in the components of negative cognitions about 
self and total score of this inventory, the two 
therape utic groups (CPT and HR) did not differ 
significantly. However,  a significant difference was 
observed between the two groups (CPT and HR) and 
the control group. In the component of self -blame, 
cognitive    processing   therapy   group    significantly  
differed from HR and control groups, but no significant 
difference was observed between cognitive processing 
and control groups.   
 
Discussion  
This research was conducted to examine the 
effectiveness of cognitive processing therapy and holographic reprocessing  on the reduction of 
posttraumatic cognitions in students exposed to trauma. 
The results of this study showed no significant 
difference between CPT and HR groups at the 
differences of pretest – post test scores, while these two 
groups differed significantl y from the control group. 
Furthermore, these two therapeutic methods were 
equally effective on the reduction of posttraumatic 
negative cognitions , particularly negative cognition 
about self and self blame.   These results are consistent 
with the results of  Resick   and Schnicke (13), Resick et 
al. (14), Monson et al. (15), Schulz et al.(16), 
Ahrens   & Rexford (17), Galovski et al. (18), in 
relation to the effectiveness of cognitive processing 
therapy, and are also in accordance with the results of 
Katz et al . (20) in relation to the effectiveness of 
holographic reprocessing on the reduction of 
posttraumatic symptoms. Foa and colleagues have 
Cognitive Processing Therapy  For Post Traumatic States  
  143 Iranian J Psychiatry 6:4, Fall 2011  emphasized the role of cognitions about self and the 
world in natural recovery from trauma, the 
development of posttraum atic disorders, and the CBT 
processes ameliorating these trauma symptoms (25); 
they correspond with the following ideas: the effects of 
these therapeutic methods on the negative cognitions 
can free the traumatized individual from other trauma 
symptoms. The   effectiveness of these therapeutic 
methods on the reduction of negative cognitions can be 
attributed to the congruence of logic of these methods 
with the features of adolescence period. Each of these 
therapeutic methods was considered an integrative 
therapy with both the exposure therapy and psycho 
social education and the cognitive techniques for the 
coping with dysfunctional cognitions. Furthermore, it 
can be noted that altering negative cognitions in 
adolescence period, where these cognitions are forme d, 
is easier than other periods of life. Similarly, both CPT 
and HR are trauma - focused cognitive behavioral 
therapies; therefore, the effect of these methods on 
negative cognitions was expected.  
On the subscales of posttraumatic cognitions inventory, 
the obtained results showed no significant difference 
between cognitive processing and holographic 
reprocessing groups on the negative cognitions about 
self, but these groups differed significantly from the 
control group on this variable; meaning that each of  
these methods were equally effective on the reduction 
of negative cognitions about self. This result is 
consistent with the results of Foa and Rauch research 
(12) on reduction of negative cognitions about self, 
following prolonged exposure therapy, and wi th the 
results of Katz et al. (20) study on the effectiveness of 
holographic reprocessing on the reduction of negative 
cognitions. Because cognitive processing therapy has 
targeted some essential components of self such as 
trust, safety, intimacy, control and respect, and 
holographic reprocessing is also based on 
intellectualizing the experiential self, it was expected 
that these therapeutic methods be effective for the 
negative cognitions about self more than controlled 
interventions. As the psychological identity and self are 
formed in the adolescence period, the experience of 
trauma can lead to development of maladaptive and 
irrational beliefs in adolescents. CPT addresses these 
negative beliefs by cognitive reconstruction and HR by 
mapping the experienti onal hologram. Therefore, 
receiving these therapies along with experiencing the 
safe environment of therapy can help modulate 
generalized and negative beliefs about self.    
On the self -blame subscale, the obtained results 
showed that holographic reprocessi ng group differed 
from both cognitive processing and control groups. 
Furthermore, holographic reprocessing therapy was 
effective for self -blame more than cognitive processing 
therapy and control intervention. These results also 
showed that cognitive proces sing group does not differ 
significantly from control group in this variable. The 
results of this study are not consistent with the results 
of those studies supporting the effectiveness of cognitive processing therapy on the symptoms of 
PTSD and comorbid d isorders (13,14,15,16,17,18), 
while they are consistent with Katz's opinion  (19) 
about holographic reprocessing therapy being effective 
for the reduction of trauma related symptoms more 
than other therapeutic methods, because it interactively 
uses the bas ic techniques of psychodynamic, cognitive - 
behavioral and experiential therapies. Similarly, after 
the experience of trauma, many people begin to blame 
their younger version of self for how they behaved at 
that time. HR can encounter a person with his/her own 
ego version by mapping experientional hologram; in 
this state, the person let go of the painful feeling about 
the younger version of self, and finally is free of the 
burden of  self blame.  
Moreover, the results of this research showed no 
significant d ifference between the three groups in the 
subscale of negative cognitions about the world, 
meaning that therapeutic methods were not effective 
for these cognitions. These results are not consistent 
with the results of Foa and Rauch (12), Resick   and 
Schnic ke (13), Resick et al. (14), Schulz et al. (16), 
Ahrens   & Rexford (17), Galovski et al. (18) in respect 
to the effectiveness of cognitive processing therapy, 
and results of Katz et al. (20). Negative beliefs about 
the world were targeted in both CPT and H R, but the 
ineffectiveness of these methods for thecognitions can 
be due to the occurrence of some traumatic events such 
as crashing the airplane of Tehran -Uremia ,and 
assassination of nucleus scientists shortly before 
conducting this research.    
In conclu sion, the results of this research revealed that 
cognitive processing therapy and holographic 
reprocessing, as the trauma related psychotherapies, 
were equally effective for the reduction of 
posttraumatic cognitions in trauma -exposed students. 
Thus, it app ears that these therapeutic methods which 
had been originally developed and tested for sexually 
assaulted females can also be applied for the victims of 
other traumatic events (death of a parent, parental 
divorce, physical abuse etc) particularly during th e 
adolescence period. Therefore, the results of the current 
study provide important evidence in the support of 
these two trauma - focused cognitive behavioral 
therapies for use in clinical setting. This research has 
some limitations. Firstly, because two mo nths after 
conducting this research, high school examination time 
and summer holidays began, it was not possible to 
follow up the study. Secondly, these three therapeutic 
interventions were applied only by one researcher. 
Thirdly, no data were available on  validity and 
reliability of Traumatic Events Screening Inventory, 
and Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory for Iranians. 
Thus, it is recommended that in the future researches, 
follow up evaluations be conducted to study the 
constancy of the therapies and in terventions applied by 
different specialists to increase the validity of these 
therapies. Furthermore, it is suggested that these 
methods be used for the victims of different traumas in 
all ages and in both genders.
