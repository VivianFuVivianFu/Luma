Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) is a psychological condition that can develop in response to prolonged, repeated trauma, particularly during childhood. Unlike traditional PTSD, which typically results from a single traumatic event, C-PTSD arises from sustained trauma, often in relationships where escape isn't possible.

Key symptoms include:
- Emotional dysregulation (difficulty managing emotions)
- Negative self-concept (deep shame, self-hatred)
- Interpersonal difficulties (problems with relationships)

[Source: cptsd_treatment.txt]
Treatment for C-PTSD often involves trauma-informed therapy approaches such as EMDR, Internal Family Systems (IFS), and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). Recovery is possible with proper support and treatment."""

Anxious attachment style is characterized by a strong desire for close relationships but fear of abandonment. People with anxious attachment often:
- Seek excessive reassurance from partners
- Experience high levels of relationship anxiety
- Have difficulty self-soothing when distressed
- May engage in protest behaviors when feeling disconnected

- Learning emotional regulation skills
- Building self-worth independent of relationships
- Practicing effective communication
- Working with a trauma-informed therapist"""

- Impact physical health and immune system
- Affect sleep quality and cognitive function
