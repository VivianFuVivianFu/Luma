# DEPLOYMENT STATUS - URGENT

## Issue: Vercel Not Updating After GitHub Connection

### Timeline:
- 2025-08-17 14:45: Connected Vercel to GitHub
- Multiple commits pushed but build files unchanged
- Current build: index-pwLA0n1p.js (unchanged for 48+ hours)

### Code Status:
✅ Disclaimer content REMOVED from src/pages/Index.tsx
✅ Customer feedback section ADDED  
✅ All commits pushed to main branch
❌ Live site still shows old content

### Expected vs Actual:
**Expected**: No disclaimer, customer testimonials visible
**Actual**: Still showing "Important Disclaimer" and "Learn about data rights"

### Next Steps Needed:
1. Check Vercel project production branch setting
2. Verify automatic deployment is enabled
3. Manual deployment trigger if needed

This file will be removed once deployment works correctly.
